# Cycle 030 — OpenAI API Metadata and Pro Virtual Models

## Objective

Add eight OpenAI API choices total: existing `gpt-5.5` plus seven GPT-5.6 ids,
of which exactly three are API-only virtual Pro choices. Keep virtual identity on OCX
catalog, selection, request-log, and usage surfaces. Upstream HTTP JSON/SSE and real
WebSocket response payloads retain the base model unchanged so the Windows native-relay
safety invariant is preserved; record that base separately as resolved identity.

## Trusted metadata owners

### MODIFY `src/types.ts`, `src/config.ts`, and `src/server/auth-cors.ts`

Add `modelMaxInputTokens?: Record<string, number>` to `OcxProviderConfig`. Disk-load
schema and management admission both require a plain own-property record of positive
finite integers. Zero, negative, fractional, string, array, null, inherited, or
non-finite values fail with 400 and do not overwrite prior config. Do not add virtual
model maps to persisted config.

### MODIFY `src/providers/registry.ts`

Add registry-only:

```ts
virtualModels?: Record<string, { wireModelId: string; reasoningMode: "pro" }>;
modelMaxInputTokens?: Record<string, number>;
```

For `openai-apikey`, set exactly eight models: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.6`,
Sol/Terra/Luna, and the three
Pro ids. Base/alias/Pro rows use 1,050,000 context, 922,000 max input, text+image,
and Codex-supported `low,medium,high,xhigh,max`. Define no generic `gpt-5.6-pro`.
Keep OpenRouter constants untouched.

### MODIFY `src/providers/derive.ts`

Clone `modelMaxInputTokens` into config hints. Do not clone registry-only virtual maps
into user/provider config or management DTOs.

### MODIFY `src/oauth/key-providers.ts` and `src/oauth/login-cli.ts`

Thread `modelMaxInputTokens` through the public key-provider DTO and CLI-created
provider config using independent clones. Prefer the canonical derived registry type
over a second hand-written metadata shape. `virtualModels` remains registry-private and
must be absent from both DTO and persisted CLI config.

### NEW `src/providers/openai-virtual-models.ts`

Export the exact contract:

```ts
interface OpenAiVirtualModelResolution {
  selectedModelId: string;
  wireModelId: string;
  reasoningMode: "pro";
}
class InvalidOpenAiVirtualModelRegistryError extends Error {}
validateOpenAiVirtualModelDefinition(
  selectedModelId: string,
  definition: unknown,
): OpenAiVirtualModelResolution;
resolveOpenAiVirtualModel(
  providerName: string,
  selectedModelId: string,
): OpenAiVirtualModelResolution | undefined;
applyOpenAiVirtualModel(
  parsed: OcxParsedRequest,
  route: RouteResult,
  logCtx: RequestLogContext,
): OpenAiVirtualModelResolution | undefined;
resolveOpenAiCompactModel(
  providerName: string,
  selectedModelId: string,
): OpenAiVirtualModelResolution | undefined;
```

The two resolvers and `validateOpenAiVirtualModelDefinition` are pure. The validator is
the deterministic activation seam for synthetic malformed registry definitions and
never mutates `PROVIDER_REGISTRY`. `applyOpenAiVirtualModel` intentionally mutates only the
passed parsed request, route, raw request model/reasoning object, and log context, and
is idempotent on second application. They read trusted registry metadata only, require
provider `openai-apikey` and exact keys, return `undefined` on ordinary no-match, throw
`InvalidOpenAiVirtualModelRegistryError` for a matched entry with a blank, namespaced,
non-string wire id or unsupported mode, and never infer from a `-pro` suffix.

Normal Responses behavior:

- preserve original namespaced selection in `logCtx.requestedModel`;
- set `logCtx.model` to selected local id such as `gpt-5.6-sol-pro`;
- rewrite `route.modelId`, `parsed.modelId`, and raw body model to base id;
- merge `reasoning.mode="pro"`, overriding a conflicting mode while preserving
  independent supported effort and other allowed reasoning fields.
- omitted or `null` raw reasoning becomes `{mode:"pro"}`; a valid object is cloned and
  merged; parser-rejected scalar/array reasoning never reaches apply. Preserve effort,
  summary, and every other parser-allowed reasoning key.

Compact behavior is fixed by the official schema: map virtual id to base id and send
no `reasoning` member because `ResponseCompactParams` has no reasoning field.
Compaction does not change the selected model stored by Codex; the next `/responses`
turn reapplies Pro mode.

## Catalog and request flow

### MODIFY `src/codex/catalog.ts`

- Extend `CatalogModel` with `maxInputTokens`.
- Provider hints read `modelMaxInputTokens`.
- Routed `auto_compact_token_limit` becomes
  `min(floor(effectiveContextWindow*0.9), maxInputTokens)`; a 350K user cap stays 315K.
- Add exact
  `augmentRoutedModelsWithRegistryOpenAiApiRows(models: CatalogModel[], config: OcxConfig): CatalogModel[]`
  after live/static gathering and before visibility/sort. When API tier is enabled it
  filters that provider to the exact eight-id trusted allowlist, removes unrelated live
  OpenAI rows, and deterministically rebuilds `gpt-5.5` plus all seven registry-owned
  GPT-5.6 rows (alias, three bases, three Pro virtuals), including rows omitted by a
  successful live `/models` response. It is a no-op unless configured `openai-apikey`
  exists and is enabled.
- Define the collision signature as provider/id, context window, max-input tokens,
  sorted unique input modalities, sorted unique reasoning efforts, and owned-by. Object
  key order and array order/duplicates are nonsemantic. Keep a process-wide warning-key
  set containing provider/id plus normalized live and trusted signatures: the same
  mismatch across repeated polls warns once, a changed mismatch warns again, and
  semantic equality never warns. Export a test-only warning reset seam.
- Treat registry 1,050,000 context and 922,000 max input as trusted baselines for these
  seven GPT-5.6 rows. Existing live metadata cannot lower or raise those baselines. Apply user
  `modelContextWindows` and `modelMaxInputTokens` only afterward as lowering caps;
  values above official limits never raise them. Do not change global cap semantics for
  nontrusted rows.
- Direct/Multi rows never receive API virtuals or API context values.

### MODIFY `src/router.ts`

Merge registry `modelMaxInputTokens` as trusted defaults, then apply user numeric hints
as lowering caps (`min`), never as overrides that raise 922K. Virtual mapping is not
placed on the route provider; the resolver receives provider name explicitly.

### MODIFY `src/server/responses.ts`

Immediately after `routeModel` and namespace stripping, call
`applyOpenAiVirtualModel` before effort caps/native clamps. Native clamp continues to
use original namespaced `requestedModel`, so routed Pro never masquerades as native.
Do not rewrite client response payloads. Preserve the existing direct native relay,
including its Windows Bun#32111 safety path. HTTP JSON/SSE and real WebSocket payloads
therefore expose the upstream base model; virtual identity remains in catalog/log/usage.
Change the compact signature to:

```ts
export async function handleResponsesCompact(
  req: Request,
  config: OcxConfig,
  logCtx: RequestLogContext,
): Promise<Response>;
```

It calls `resolveOpenAiCompactModel`, emits the base id only, and sets
`logCtx.model` to the selected local virtual id, `logCtx.requestedModel` to the
original namespaced id, `logCtx.resolvedModel` to the base id, and
`logCtx.provider` to `route.providerName`.

### MODIFY `src/server/index.ts`

For `POST /v1/responses/compact`, allocate request id/start time and a
`RequestLogContext` before calling `handleResponsesCompact(req, config, logCtx)`.
Remove the compact handler's private context. `src/server/index.ts` is the sole
allocator/finalizer and calls direct `addFinalRequestLog` exactly once after the
fully buffered handler returns. The handler passes `req.signal` to upstream fetch and
uses a local incremental reader with exact `COMPACT_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES = 32 * 1024 *
1024`; it never calls unbounded `arrayBuffer()`. A `Content-Length` above the cap cancels
the reader before reading; chunked input stops as soon as accumulated bytes exceed the
cap, cancels the reader, and returns 502 `compact_response_too_large` with no partial
relay. It does not return an unconsumed body. Client abort during fetch/body read returns 499, body-read/connect
failure returns 502, local body/schema/auth failures keep their 4xx, and upstream 4xx/
5xx status/body are relayed after buffering. Unexpected throws are caught by index,
which emits one sanitized 500 and one log row. Every success/failure/cancel outcome
therefore produces exactly one row after its final status is knowable. Compact usage may
remain `unreported`, but the persisted entry preserves all three model identities.

### MODIFY `src/server/request-log.ts` and `src/usage/log.ts`

Add `requestedModel?: string` to `PersistedUsageEntry`, its JSON normalizer, and the
`addRequestLog` persistence payload. Then use the fields with fixed ownership:

- `model` = selected local id (virtual id for Pro);
- `requestedModel` = original caller id including provider namespace;
- `resolvedModel` = upstream response/base model.

`addRequestLog` persists selected `model`, namespaced `requestedModel`, and optional
base `resolvedModel` unchanged. No separate wire-id field is added.

### VERIFY `src/usage/summary.ts` (no production change expected)

Existing grouping by provider + persisted selected `model` is already correct; never
group by `resolvedModel`. Add only a regression proving three Pro rows do not collapse
into bases.

## Tests and activation proof

### MODIFY `tests/provider-registry-parity.test.ts`

Assert eight OpenAI API ids total and exact seven GPT-5.6 ids (alias, three bases,
three Pro), official metadata, three mappings, no generic alias, and no virtual map in
derived management config.

### MODIFY `tests/codex-catalog.test.ts`

Assert the exact eight-id allowlist survives successful live discovery that omits
`gpt-5.5`, the alias, and Pro ids while including an unrelated model; unrelated rows
are removed and one conflicting trusted row is replaced. Cover live context
below/above 1.05M and user caps below/above official values: 922K uncapped, 315K at a
350K context cap, never 945K. Assert absent and disabled API tier expose zero API rows,
an identical live row emits no warning, repeated semantically identical mismatches warn
once across polls, differently ordered equivalent arrays do not warn, and a changed
mismatch signature warns again. Reset the process warning set between tests.
Assert Direct/Multi metadata isolation.

### NEW `tests/openai-api-virtual-models.test.ts`

Use `startServer`, exact `globalThis.fetch` URL interception that throws on every
unknown URL, and `afterEach` restoration. Capture HTTP, HTTP SSE, and a real WebSocket
upgrade plus `response.create` for all three Pro ids. Assert API URL/key,
base wire model, mode Pro, preserved effort, selected log model, namespaced requested
model, base resolved model, unchanged client-visible upstream base model, and zero
Codex account headers. Base models, other
providers, unknown `-pro`, and forged config maps remain unchanged/rejected.

Capture compact requests for standard and all Pro ids. Assert API key + base model and
absence of `reasoning`; Direct/Multi compact behavior remains Cycle-020-owned. Query
`/api/logs` and inspect the temporary usage JSONL to assert virtual `model`, namespaced
`requestedModel`, base `resolvedModel`, routed provider (never `unknown`), and compact
usage status `unreported`.

Add exact resolver tests for match/no-match, other provider, blank/namespaced wire id,
unsupported mode, omitted/null/conflicting reasoning, effort/summary preservation,
parser-rejected non-object shapes, and second-application idempotence. Malformed
definitions use `validateOpenAiVirtualModelDefinition` with synthetic values and never
mutate the global registry.

Compact tests include abort during fetch, abort during body read, body-read failure,
local 4xx, upstream 4xx/5xx, and success; each yields exactly one `/api/logs` and JSONL
row with the final status. Add oversized `Content-Length` and chunked-overflow cases:
both cancel the reader, return one 502 `compact_response_too_large`, relay no partial
bytes, and persist exactly one final log row.

### MODIFY `tests/config.test.ts`, `tests/server-auth.test.ts`,
`tests/provider-registry-parity.test.ts`, and `tests/umans-provider.test.ts`

Disk and management boundaries accept only plain positive-integer max-input maps and
preserve old config on every rejection. Key-provider DTO and CLI config contain an
independently cloned map but no virtual mapping. Reserved API metadata remains trusted
and management cannot inject virtual mappings.

### MODIFY `tests/request-log.test.ts`, `tests/usage-log.test.ts`, and
`tests/usage-summary.test.ts`

After HTTP, WS, and compact Pro requests, query `/api/logs` and reread usage JSONL.
Assert selected virtual `model`, namespaced `requestedModel`, base `resolvedModel`,
and routed provider; summaries group by virtual id.

## Verification and exit gate

```sh
bun test tests/config.test.ts tests/server-auth.test.ts tests/provider-registry-parity.test.ts tests/umans-provider.test.ts tests/codex-catalog.test.ts tests/openai-api-virtual-models.test.ts tests/request-log.test.ts tests/usage-log.test.ts tests/usage-summary.test.ts
bun x tsc --noEmit
```

Accept only when every advertised virtual id has captured HTTP/HTTP-SSE/real-WS/compact
wire and client-response base identity proof; each compact outcome logs exactly once; every
fetch URL is exact; and no provider/config/body outside the exact API mappings is
transformed.
